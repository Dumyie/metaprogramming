# Metaprogramming exercise

The goals here is to implement a record structure that allows for an easy declarative programming structure. This is a toy exercise but utilizes techniques similar to projects like the Django ORM to allow for the behavior and structure of classes to be defined very declaratively. You must implement the Record class such that the fields are defined declaratively. The fields define a human readably label as well as a precondition which can check properties of a field on construction. The type of a field is defined by the attribute type annotation.
